Environment: This is a R script created on R studio.

Develop reseason: It is very annoying that while fitting the linear model, still need to use abline to plot line.

Drawbacks:
(1) only can fit a single independent variable to a single respond variable;
(2) only two colors - red (P < 0.05) and black (P > 0.05) to show;
(3) only two line type - solid (P > 0.05) and dash (P < 0.05) to show
