Environment: This is a R script created on R studio.

Develop reseason: It is very annoying that while fitting the linear model, still need to use abline to plot line.

Drawbacks:
only can fit a single independent variable to a single respond variable
only two colors - red (P < 0.05) and black (P > 0.05) to show
only two line type - solid (P > 0.05) and dash (P < 0.05) to show
