# lmln

This is a R script created on R studio.

It is very annoying that while fitting the linear model, still need to use abline to plot line.

Therefore, we creat the funtion lmln() to fit linear model while draw the line.

only two colors - red (P < 0.05) and black (P > 0.05) to choose.
only two line type - solid (P > 0.05) and dash (P < 0.05) to choose.
